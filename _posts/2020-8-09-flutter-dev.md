Just noting down some useful things for Flutter Dev

### Setup

The easiest setup on a mac uses [homebrew formula] (https://github.com/flschweiger/homebrew-flutter). Assuming you have already installed xCode and Android Studio, you are good to go in a few minutes!

### VS Code extensions

[Bracket colorizer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=CoenraadS.bracket-pair-colorizer-2) and [pubSpec assist](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=jeroen-meijer.pubspec-assist). There are also a bunch more listed [here](https://medium.com/flutter-community/must-have-vs-code-extensions-for-working-with-flutter-e31a421b9c68)

### Linting ###

### Jitpack ###
If you are going to create your own Android Libraries, then you can use [Jitpack](https://jitpack.io) to build your library, so that you can pull it in as a Gradle ``implementation`` dependency. It works best with Github, especially now that they have free private repos. If you want Jitpack to build private repos, you need to pay for that service.

### Dependency injection ###


### Putting your money where your mouth is ###
The following things are worth paying for:
* [Gitkraken](https://www.gitkraken.com/)
* [Jitpack](https://jitpack.io)
* [Cool logo generator!](https://looka.com/)

### PNG to SVG ###
