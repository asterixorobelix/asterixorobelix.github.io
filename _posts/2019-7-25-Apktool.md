An Android .apk is basically just a fancy zip file. If someone wanted to they could downnload your app, extract it and inspect your source code. [DexGuard](https://www.guardsquare.com/en/blog/setting-up-dexguard-android-studio) is a way to prevent this by obfuscating the code inside your apk.

In order to verify that DexGuard is working, you can use a program like [ApkTool](https://ibotpeaches.github.io/Apktool/) to inspect the assets inside the apk and verify that they have been obfuscated. Although there are [install instructions](https://ibotpeaches.github.io/Apktool/install/), I experienced a few gotchas for using it on my mac.

You download the jar and place it in the ```/usr/local/bin```.
You then need to open a command line window at that ```/bin``` location.
You can then ```java -jar nameOFDownloadedJarInBinFolder``` in order to invoke Apktool. For example, ```java -jar apktool.jar```

One thing to note is that Apktool extracts your jar in the ```/bin``` folder, taking the folder name from the apk name, unless you specify a different folder to extract to.
So, for instance ```$ apktool d bar.apk``` decodes bar.apk to bar folder in the ```/bin``` where apktool.jar is being invoked.

In order to change the output folder: ```apktool d bar.apk -o baz ``` which would decode the bar.apk to the baz folder.

A folder with a number of [.smali](https://fileinfo.com/extension/smali) files are created, which contain human readable files (open with vscode etc).

An even better option is to use [dex2jar](https://sourceforge.net/p/dex2jar/wiki/UserGuide/) to convert the apk to a .jar file. One thing to note is that on my Mac I needed to adjust the permissions of d2j_invoke.sh in order for dex2jar to work: ```sudo chmod +x d2j_invoke.sh``` as mentioned in this [SO article](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30875382/cannot-use-dex2jar-on-my-mac-permission-denied)

You can then ```sudo sh /Users/nathanstasin/Desktop/dex2jar-2.0/d2j-dex2jar.sh /Users/nathanstasin/Desktop/afrikaburn-18.apk``` which will create a ```someApk-dex2jar.jar``` jar in the dex2jar-2.0 working folder.

You can then open this jar with [JD-GUI](http://java-decompiler.github.io/). However, I was getting a weird error on my Mac (which you can see in the image below) and needed to modify the created .jar file's permissions in order to get JD-GUI to open the file: ```sudo chmod +xr /Users/nathanstasin/Desktop/dex2jar-2.0/afrikaburn-v18-dex2jar.jar```

You can then verify that code has been obfuscated in JD-GUI
