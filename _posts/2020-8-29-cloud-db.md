![The cloud](https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fi1.wp.com%2Fmemecreator.org%2Fstatic%2Fimages%2Fmemes%2F4232302.jpg%3Fresize%3D696%252C421%26ssl%3D1&f=1&nofb=1)

When developing apps, eventually you will want a cloud hosted database, often referred to as Backend as a Service (BaaS) or Database as a Service (Daas). It is quite difficult and time consuming to understand the pros and cons of the different options and it may also be extremely difficult to change once you are far down your development road on a project.

### Firebase Firestore

[Firestore](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore) is the default cloud hosted database. It has some great features, such as local caching of the database for offline usage. However, it has some problems.
Firstly, it is a [NOSQL database](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/architecture/cloud-native/relational-vs-nosql-data), which can make complex queries difficult. Also, currently, there is no indexing on the local database, so offline queries are often unacceptably slow. Finally, the pricing model is a little difficult to understand.

## Alternatives

### AWS Amplify
[Amplify](https://aws.amazon.com/amplify/) is Amazon's alternative to Firebase and [DataStore](https://aws.amazon.com/amplify/features/#DataStore) would be the direct competitor to Firestore. DataStore has [SDKs](https://docs.amplify.aws/start) for Android, iOS and Flutter (Preview).

### ParsePlatform
[Parse](https://parseplatform.org/) was developed by Facebook and has now been opensourced. It provides much of the Firestore functionality, including object and file storage, user authentication, push notifications. It has iOS, Android and Xamarin SDKs, but no Flutter SDK.

### Back4App
[Back4App](https://www.back4app.com/compare-all-plans) have built on top of Parse, and have a simple pricing model. They have an [Android, iOS and Xamarin SDK](https://www.back4app.com/docs/get-started/backend-as-a-service), but no Flutter. They also have [publically accessible cloud databases](https://www.back4app.com/database) for different types of information, such as cities, countries - which may be useful for developing apps. All [South African cities](https://www.back4app.com/database/back4app/list-of-cities-in-south-africa/dataset-api) looks cool

### SpaceCloud
[SpaceCloud](https://github.com/spaceuptech/space-cloud) presents itself as an openSource alternative to Firebase, including cloud hosted databases.

### ElephantSQL

[ElephantSQL](https://www.elephantsql.com/) is a cloud hosted SQL database.

### MongoDB Realm
[Realm](https://www.mongodb.com/realm) is currently in beta, but looks promising because of its ability to sync across multiple devices.
