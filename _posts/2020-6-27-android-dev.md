Just noting down some useful things for Android Dev

### Jitpack ###
If you are going to create your own Android Libraries, then you can use [Jitpack](https://jitpack.io) to build your library, so that you can pull it in as a Gradle ``implementation`` dependency. It works best with Github, especially now that they have free private repos. If you want Jitpack to build private repos, you need to pay for that service.

### Dependency injection ###


### Putting your money where your mouth is ###
