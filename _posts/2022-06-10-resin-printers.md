## Machines
* [Anycubic](https://www.anycubic.com/) - ridiculous shipping prices to SA. May as well get from Amazon
* [Elegoo](https://www.elegoo.com/) - doesnt ship to SA at all
* [Bangood](https://www.banggood.com/Wholesale-3D-Printer-c-10808.html) - cheapest shipping to SA, fairly limited stock.
* [Aliexpress Anycubic store](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005002482561409.html?spm=a2g0o.store_pc_groupList.8148356.4.465b1e0cirvOoV&pdp_npi=2%40dis%21ZAR%21ZAR%2011%2C334.96%21ZAR%209%2C067.97%21%21%21%21%21%402100bdec16549451440156754e7185%2112000029007011413%21sh) - pretty expensive shipping to SA too. Could save with import duties, so maybe worth it.
* [Creality](https://www.creality.com/pages/products?collection=Resin+3D+Printers&spm=..index.header_1.1) - many suppliers in SA, which is a good reason to get it. Halot style seems great.

## Slicers
* [Lychee](https://mango3d.io/lychee-slicer-supported-3d-printers/)
* Prusa Slicer
* [Chitubox](https://www.chitubox.com/en/index)

## Resins
Quite expensive, unsure how long a liter lasts, but you will definitely want to prototype with FDM first. Messy too.
