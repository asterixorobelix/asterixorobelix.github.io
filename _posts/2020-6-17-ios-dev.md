I've recently started doing some native iOS Swift/UIKit dev work.

### Linting ###
Been enjoying using a linter like [SwiftLint](https://infinum.com/handbook/books/ios/SwiftLint). The linter is applied every time xcode builds. In the terminal, you can navigate to the project folder and ```swiftlint autocorrect```. This will apply all the lint rules from swiftlint.yml.
Be sure to change your xCode settings, so that SwiftLint nags you less!

You can also add swift linting as a build stage in xcode.

### namespaces ###
Its kind of strange that Swift doesnt support namespacing, but [local packages](https://medium.com/swlh/organizing-your-xcode-swift-code-with-local-packages-469cda06f82d) are a useful alternative.

### Android ###
Coming from Android native development, I found the [this](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/example-code/language/tips-for-android-developers-switching-to-swift) article to be helpful. Basically: ```LinearLayout``` = ```UIStackView``` and ```Fragment``` = ```UIViewController``` (but iOS has more lifecycle events).
Architecturally, [this](https://blog.usejournal.com/ios-vs-android-app-architecture-similarities-5f91cc7d4296) article was helpful with outlining the similarities. Basically, ```AppDelegate``` = ```MainActivity``` and ```UITableView``` = ```RecyclerView```.

### Dependency injection ###
I am a big fan of Koin for serviceLocation/DI on Android. [Resolver](https://github.com/hmlongco/Resolver) looks promising as an alternative on [iOS](https://medium.com/better-programming/taking-swift-dependency-injection-to-the-next-level-b71114c6a9c6).

### Cocoapods ###
If you use [CocoaPods](https://guides.cocoapods.org) for your dependency management, you can ```brew install cocoapods``` to install cocoapods.Close your xcode project. Then, in your project directory, ```pod init``` and edit the resulting pod file according to the [documentation](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/using-cocoapods.html). Finally, ```pod install```.


### AutoLayout ###
[WTF Autolayout?](https://www.wtfautolayout.com/) can be helpful with debugging layout constraint errors. [Tiny Constraints](https://github.com/roberthein/TinyConstraints) also looks like it will take some of the pains away.

### Templating ###
Its very annoying that code does not do the importing automatically (when would I not use UIKit?), so you can [adjust the default Swift template](https://medium.com/itch-design-no/creating-your-own-templates-in-xcode-98a08bf20038) to provide the import. Just go to ```/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Library/Xcode/Templates/File\ Templates/Source/Swift\ File.xctemplate``` and edit it with Vscode or something (you will need sudo in order to save it).

### xCode ###
Xcode quite frankly is miles behind Android Studio. Intellij have a [paid for product](https://www.jetbrains.com/objc/) which looks much better.
